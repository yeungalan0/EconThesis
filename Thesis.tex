\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

In higher education, economists and prospective students often use the performance measures of the student body as a proxy measure for the quality of the institution \citep{smith2015new,sarmiento2015quality,black2006estimating}.
For example, the average high school GPA, average SAT score, and average class rank are all common reported characteristics of an institution and indicators of institutional quality.
The underlying idea of using the quality of the student body as a measure for the quality of the institution, is that the quality of one's peers matter. 
Indeed, several studies have shown that peer quality has a positive impact on long term student outcomes, such as graduation rates and cumulative GPA \citep{smith2015new,luppino2015college,ost2010role}. 
Naturally, these findings lead to another area of research, identifying the specific areas of a student's life where peer effects are most significant. 
One of the most obvious areas for a strong effect to exist is in the classroom.
Thus, we seek to understand peer effects in the classroom, specifically how the ability of one's classmates impacts a student's class grade.

This study contributes to the literature in two ways.
First, this is the first study of it's kind (known to us) to research peer effects at the classroom level at this type of institution (a small private liberal arts college).
Whereas the majority of other studies focus on K-12 education, we analyze the peer effects at an institution of higher education.
Second, due to our access to data, we are able to use a unique method (at least in terms of classroom peer effects literature\footnote{Most of the literautre uses quasi-random assignments or fixed effects models. See \sectlabel{litreview} for more details.}) to analyze the data and combat selection bias, a serious problem in studies of this type \citep{carman2012classroom,burke2013classroom,ding2007peers}. 

Using data from a small private liberal arts college in the mid-west we find that, regardless of the changes we applied to the peer measure, the proportion of high achieving students in a class has a small but significant negative impact on the grades of middle achieving students. 
Additionally, we find that, when the peer measure is at its strictest level, the proportion of low achieving students in a class has a small but positive impact on the grades of middle achieving students. 
These results are contrary to those found in most of the current literature \citep{kang2007classroom,carman2012classroom,burke2013classroom,schlosser2008inside,lavy2012good}, which may be due to changing peer dynamics from K-12 education to higher education, grade curving occurring in classes at the institution, or a combination of both.
Though these results are interesting, it is unclear how well they generalize to other institutions, of different types and the same type, due to the current scarcity of literature. 

The structure of the paper is as follows: 
We discuss the related literature in section~\ref{litreview}. 
In section~\ref{data}, we examine the data used in this study. 
In section~\ref{methods}, we describe our empirical methodology.
We present our results, discuss the implications, and offer suggestions for further research in section~\ref{results}.
Lastly, we conclude in section~\ref{conclusion}.

\section{Literature Review}\label{litreview}

\citet{smith2015new}, \citet{luppino2015college}, and \citet{ost2010role} show that peer effects have important long term impacts on cumulative GPA and graduation rates at institutions of higher education.
These are important broad findings, which have naturally led to a more narrow focus in the literature.
Much of the current literature focuses on identifying the areas of a student's life where peer effects are most significant. 

For instance, roommate peer effects research has been a trending topic, due to the natural quasi-random roommate assignments made by many institutions of higher education.
Quasi-random roommate assignments, such as those used in \citet{griffith2014peer} and \citet{zimmerman2003peer}, allow researchers to avoid the perils of selection bias and lead to theoretically more accurate results.
However, most of the literature is divided on whether or not roommate peer effects exist \citep{griffith2014peer,zimmerman2003peer,sacerdote2000peer,foster2006s,mcewan2006roommate}.
This is a testament to the difficulty of finding peer effects and the difficulty of solving the econometric problems that exist in peer effects modeling.

Our research adds to the growing (but currently scarce) literature focused on peer effects in the classroom.
In a similar vain to the roommate peer effects literature, much of the literature on peer effects in the classroom exploits quasi-random classroom assignments.
For instance, \citet{kang2007classroom} exploit the quasi-random classroom assignments in South Korean middle schools, and \citet{carman2012classroom} utilize the fact that students are assigned to Chinese middle schools either randomly or through an admissions test.
Both studies focused on determining the significance of peer effects on classroom grades, and find evidence of peer effects.
\citeauthor{kang2007classroom} finds that strong students\footnote{For our purposes, any qualitative measure of students abilities (high or low achiever, strong or weak student, etc.) refers to students relative acadmeic performance (usually on standardized tests). This is standard practice in all of the related literature \citep{carman2012classroom,burke2013classroom,kang2007classroom,schlosser2008inside,lavy2012good}} have a positive impact on the academic performance of other students, while weak students have a negative effect on the performance of other students. 
\citeauthor{carman2012classroom} find somewhat mixed results, but in general they find evidence of positive and significant peer effects on the impact of classmate quality on the academic performance of other students.
Other studies use econometric techniques, such as fixed effects modeling, to correct for any selection bias.
For example, \citet{schlosser2008inside} and \citet{lavy2012good} control for fixed effects when studying the peer effects of underachievers and overachievers on other students in secondary schools.
Both studies find evidence of peer effects where a larger proportion of lower achieving students in a high school class has a negative impact on the achievement of ``regular'' students in the class.
\citeauthor{lavy2012good} in particular find a positive peer effect from high achieving peers on girls.
Additionally, \citet{burke2013classroom} use fixed effects modeling to analyze the peer effects in Florida public school classrooms.
In general, \citeauthor{burke2013classroom} find results in line with the majority of other studies, an increase in the fraction of relatively higher achieving peers makes other students better off and an increase in the fraction of relatively lower achieving peers makes other students worse off.
However, there are a few notable exceptions.
\citeauthor{burke2013classroom} find that high achieving students benefit from an increased fraction of low or high achieving students, and in middle school mathematics, middle achievers benefit from a higher fraction of low achievers.
The authors suggest that the intellectual distance between high achievers and low achievers may be the reason for their former finding.
They explain that the intellectual distance may be so vast as to be a barrier to communication between the two groups, whereas high achievers can communicate effectively with the less intellectually distanced middle achievers (making high achievers worse off). 
Unfortunately, \citeauthor{burke2013classroom} do not provide an explanation for their later finding which resembles one of the results of this paper.
With the few exceptions found by \citet{burke2013classroom}, the majority of the literature finds that a larger proportion of higher achievers in a class has a positive impact on the academic performance of other students, and a larger proportion of low achievers in a class has a negative impact on the academic performance of other students.%\footnote{See the \nameref{results} section for the reasoning.}%

Whereas the majority of other studies focus on K-12 education, we add to the literature by analyzing the peer effects in higher education. 
It is possible that the peer dynamics change in the transition from secondary education to higher education, and our data set gives us a unique opportunity to analyze these peer dynamics.
% Additionally, our data set comes from a small liberal arts institution which should make it an excellent environment to see magnified peer effects.\footnote{For more details see \sectlabel{summarystats}.}

% We found peer effects, but as to how generalizable they are or how large they are we cannot be certain

Several studies have found that the quality of ones peers at an institution of higher learning has a positive impact on long term outcomes, such as graduation rates and cumulative GPA \citep{smith2015new,luppino2015college,ost2010role}.
We seek to answer the question of whether or not peer quality matters in the short term, particularly at the classroom level, and find small but significant effects from the proportion of high achievers and low achievers in a class on the grades of middle achievers. 
The results indicate that the proportion of high achievers in a class has a negative impact on the grades of middle achievers, while the proportion of low achievers in a class has a positive impact on the grades of middle achievers. 
These results are novel and run counter to those found in the majority of the current literature \citep{kang2007classroom,carman2012classroom,burke2013classroom,schlosser2008inside,lavy2012good}, which may be due to changing peer dynamics from K-12 education to higher education, grade curving occurring in classes at the institution, or a combination of both.
 
Due to data limitations we are unable to uncover how classmate ability impacts the grades of high and low achievers, which makes it challenging to prescribe any practical policy recommendations.
Additionally, the type of institution studied was relatively unique, and it is not clear how generalizable these results are. 
Fortunately, these study limitations create promising avenues for future research.
Particularly promising areas of future research include comparing the classroom level peer effects at different types of institutions (such as community colleges or large universities), and, following in the footsteps of \citet{oosterbeek2014gender}, looking at classroom peer effects from a gender peer effects perspective.
