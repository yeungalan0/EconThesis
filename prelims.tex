I'd like to thank my thesis advisor, Pedro de Araujo, for all of the advice, support, and wisdom he has provided me throughout this process. I'd also like to thank Kevin Rask for his help in the data acquisition process and all of his quick responses to my many questions and requests. Without these two, this thesis would not have been possible.
